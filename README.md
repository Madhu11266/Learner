# Learner Mobile app
This app is similar to quiz typed preparation app.
I made this mobile app for my mini project for using online resources i.e..,google,youtube.
If you find anything useful  in this project you can use this resources.

Now I will explain how it works:

First there will be a login activity if you are new to the app you have to register in register activity . Passwords and Usernames will store in mobile database itself .

After clicking continue you will get menu activity.
In that manu you can select any one of the practice or books.

In practice section there will be a three different modes of difficulties i.e.,easy,medium and hard and also a section to select subject.
and also timer for 30sec for each question.
